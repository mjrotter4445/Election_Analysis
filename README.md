## Overview of the Project
Election analysis with Python programs to calculate a number of significant summaries for further analysis.  The raw data is in a csv file for us to retrieve.    

### Purpose 
The purpose of the analysis is to generate a vote count report to certify the U.S. congressional race in a Colorado precinct and report the following: 
-	The **total number** of votes cast 
-	The complete **list of counties** in the congressional precinct
-	The **county with the highest** turnout
-	The completed **list of candidates** who received votes
-	The **percentage of votes** each candidate won and 
-	The **total number of votes each candidate** received
-	The **winner** of the election based on popular vote 
-	
### Background
The results are gathered with three primary voting methods including; Mail in Ballots, Punch Cards, 
and DRE (Direct-recording electronic counting) memory cards.

### Election-Audit Summary
In this analysis and reporting exercise was for a particular district and that districts candidates.  This program code 
was written using csv data files, variables, dictionaries and lists we looped through to get the results you see here.   
The same program could be run on another data file for another precinct, if you wish.
